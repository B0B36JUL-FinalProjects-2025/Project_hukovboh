# TVModels [![Aqua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaTesting/Aqua.jl/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JuliaTesting/Aqua.jl)

This project develops a Julia package for nonparametric and semi-parametric modeling of time-varying relationships in time series data. The package combines kernel regression methods with time-varying parameter (TVP) regression, state space models, and Bayesian methods to flexibly capture gradual structural changes, nonstationarity, and evolving dynamics. The package provides tools for estimation, bandwidth selection, forecasting, and model diagnostics. Finally, I apply the methods to financial time series, comparing and evaluating different models.
